Implement using article_default and iterator-mode

Add as many site configs as possible

Once iterator-mode fails for a site switch to collector-mode

Once enough data is collected by iterator-mode no need to do specific-extraction

Use jsoup to perform specific-extraction

Create an extraction module
---------------------------
jsoup
json configs with jsoup query
json configs to contain other required data

extract node and parse it to another extractor which 

extracts column/named data and passes to a data-consumer

data-consumer should have methods begin() and flush()
